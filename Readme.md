# Metalify-Riot-Starter

**this is still in alpha**

Website generator with Metalsmith, Netlify / NetlifyCMS and Riot JS

## Quick start

1. **Clone** this repo and install dependencies:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

1. **Build** static site in `build/` folder:

  ```
  make build dev=true
  ```

  With the **dev** flag this will rebuild on changes in the source folder and serve the build folder in your browser on `localhost:8080`)

1. **Deploy to Netlify**

   - Sign Up at [netlify.com][netlify] with github (has other options)
   - click _"New site from git"_ button somewhere
   - follow instructions
    - […]
    - … build command: `make build`

1. **Setup datoCMS** (not so quick)

  - Sign up at at [datocms.com][dato]
  - create a *model (singele type)* "index" with these *fields*:
    - title *(single-line-string)*
    - content *(Multiple-paragraph text)*
  - create a *model* "post" with these *fields*:
    - title *(single-line-string)*
    - slug *(Slug)*
    - date *(DateTime)*
    - content *(Multiple-paragraph text)*
  - Create items in "Content" tab to mirror the contents from `src/content/`
  - Go to `Settings > API tokens` and copy *"Read-only API token"*
  - Back in Project: Create a new file in root folder: `.env`
  - paste the API token in there: `DATO_API_TOKEN=<API-TOKEN-HERE>`
  - **IMPORTANT:** Don't add `.env` to VCS

5. Now you can run your site locally with content from DatoCMS. To make it ready for production and let it update automatically online, you finally need to **connect netlify and DatoCMS**:
  - At DatoCMS go to `Settings > Deployment settings`
  - Choose environment (if you are not sure, choos "Production")
  - Click the Netlify "one click setup" button
  - Go to `Settings > API tokens` and copy *"Read-only API token"*
  - Go to Netlify `Settings > Build & deploy > Build environment variables`
  - Click "Edit variables" -> "New variable"
  - key = *"DATO_API_TOKEN"*; value = *(PASTE-API-TOKEN-HERE)*

> An extremely simple, _pluggable_ static site generator.

**Customized!**

The _metalsmith-layouts_ plugin has been customized so it can process layout definitions without file extension. Example:

```markdown
---
title: My title
layout: default
---

# My content page
```

The used file extension defaults to `.html` and can be overriden with `layoutExtension`. Example for ``/index.js`:

```Javascript
.use(layouts({
  engine: 'pug',
  directory: './src/layouts',
  layoutExtension: '.pug', //custom option
  pattern: 'content/**/*.html'
}))
```

In original metalsmith the markdown file would look like this:

```markdown
---
title: My title
layout: default.pug
---

# My content page
```
