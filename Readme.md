> An extremely simple, _pluggable_ static site generator.

**Customized!**

The _metalsmith-layouts_ plugin has been customized so it can process layout definitions without file extension. Example:

```markdown
---
title: My title
layout: default
---

# My content page
```

The used file extension defaults to `.html` and can be overriden with `layoutExtension`. Example for ``/index.js`:

```Javascript
.use(layouts({
  engine: 'pug',
  directory: './src/layouts',
  layoutExtension: '.pug', //custom option
  pattern: 'content/**/*.html'
}))
```

In original metalsmith the markdown file would look like this:

```markdown
---
title: My title
layout: default.pug
---

# My content page
```
