## Plugins

Check out the website for a list of [plugins](http://www.metalsmith.io#the-community-plugins).

## API

Checkout the [project scaffolder](examples/project-scaffolder) or [build tool](examples/build-tool) examples to see a real example of the Javascript API in use.

#### new Metalsmith(dir)

Create a new `Metalsmith` instance for a working `dir`.

#### #use(plugin)

Add the given `plugin` function to the middleware stack. Metalsmith uses
[ware](https://github.com/segmentio/ware) to support middleware, so plugins
should follow the same pattern of taking arguments of `(files, metalsmith, callback)`,
modifying the `files` or `metalsmith.metadata()` argument by reference, and then
calling `callback` to trigger the next step.

#### #build(fn)

Build with the given settings and a callback having signature `fn(err, files)`.

#### #source(path)

Set the relative `path` to the source directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The source directory defaults to `./src`.

#### #destination(path)

Set the relative `path` to the destination directory, or get the full one if no `path` is provided. The destination directory defaults to `./build`.

#### #concurrency(max)

Set the maximum number of files to open at once when reading or writing.  Defaults to `Infinity`.  To avoid having too many files open at once (`EMFILE` errors), set the concurrency to something lower than `ulimit -n`.

#### #clean(boolean)

Set whether to remove the destination directory before writing to it, or get the current setting. Defaults to `true`.

#### #frontmatter(boolean)

Set whether to parse YAML frontmatter. Defaults to `true`.

#### #ignore(path)

Ignore files/paths from being loaded into Metalsmith.

`path` can be a string, a function, or an array of strings and/or functions.
Strings use the glob syntax from
[minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) to match files and directories
to ignore. Functions are called with the full path to the file as their first
argument, and the `stat` object returned by Node's `fs.stat` function as their
second argument, and must return either `true` to ignore the file, or `false` to
keep it.

#### #metadata(json)

Get the global metadata. This is useful for plugins that want to set global-level metadata that can be applied to all files.

#### #path(paths...)

Resolve any amount of `paths...` relative to the working directory. This is useful for plugins who want to read extra assets from another directory, for example `./layouts`.

#### #run(files, fn)

Run all of the middleware functions on a dictionary of `files` and callback with `fn(err, files)`, where `files` is the altered dictionary.

#### #process(fn)

Process the files like build without writing any files. Callback signature `fn(err, files)`.

## Metadata API

Add metadata to your files to access these build features. By default, Metalsmith uses a few different metadata fields:

- `contents` - The body content of the file, not including any [YAML frontmatter](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/).
- `mode` - The numeric version of the [file's mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_%28Unix%29).

You can add your own metadata in two ways:

- Using [YAML frontmatter](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/frontmatter/) at the top of any file.
- Enabling [a plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/blob/master/Readme.md#plugins) that adds metadata programmatically.

#### mode

Set the mode of the file. For example,

```
$ cat cleanup.sh

--
mode: 0764
--

rm -rf .
```

would be built with mode ```-rwxrw-r--```, i.e. user-executable.
